title: "I Said Yes When I Already Knew"
---

By year five, we were comfortable. Birthday parties, conferences, triathlons, corporate videos for engineering companies. The engineering work was second nature to me. But comfortable felt like a ceiling, and I wanted to grow.

An ex-client had moved to a new company and approached us about documenting customer events for a whisky brand launch. Six videos. New challenge. We said yes before I'd fully processed my own hesitation.

Here's the part I don't usually lead with: I lied.

When she asked if we had experience in this space, I made a confident statement about our capabilities. Deep down, I knew it wasn't true. I was clueless about luxury. I didn't desire luxury brands, didn't understand the people who collected watches and whisky and designer labels. That world and mine didn't overlap at any point.

It showed almost immediately.

Our usual projects had ten to fifteen edit points per piece. The whisky videos generated thirty to forty. Four to five rounds of revisions instead of our typical two. My team couldn't grasp what the client wanted because, honestly, neither could I. We were technically competent but culturally illiterate. Every revision felt like translating between languages we didn't speak.

Meanwhile — and this is the part that made it undeniable — we were simultaneously working with a shipbuilding company. Same team. Same timeline. And everything clicked. We instinctively understood their story. The footage felt right on the first pass. The client was enthusiastic. It reminded my team why they loved this work.

Same people. Same tools. Completely different results. The variable wasn't skill. It was fit.

After the second whisky video, I made the call. I sat down with the client and told her the truth: it was in her best interest for us to step back. If we continued, we'd frustrate each other further, damage our working relationship, and she'd end up in a worse position with her own leadership. She should find a team that lived and breathed this world.

What I expected was anger. What I got was relief.

She went from frustrated to grateful. Not because we'd done great work — we hadn't — but because I'd been honest about the mismatch instead of grinding through four more mediocre videos to collect the fee. She sourced another team for videos three through six. The relationship survived. In fact, it improved.

That experience taught me something I now consider fundamental: growth doesn't mean saying yes to everything. You can't tell stories about worlds you don't belong to or value. The lie wasn't just to the client. It was to myself — pretending that ambition and capability are the same thing.

<p class="story-reflection">Since then, we've been deliberate about fit. Engineering stories, industrial narratives, complex technical subjects — that's where we belong. Not because we can't learn other domains, but because the work is better when the understanding is instinctive rather than performed.</p>
