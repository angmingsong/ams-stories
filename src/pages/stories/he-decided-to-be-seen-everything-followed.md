title: "He Decided to Be Seen. Everything Followed."
---

When he told me he was moving on, I felt something I didn't expect. Not pride, though I felt that too. It was closer to envy — and it took me a moment to understand what exactly I was envious of.

It was early COVID. Everything had moved online overnight and companies were scrambling to find engineers willing to appear on screen. Webinars had stopped being a marketing option and become the only room left. My client called me and put his name forward as a candidate. I listened to him speak during a preliminary call and told her, honestly, that I'd seen more natural talent. She said there weren't many volunteers. I understood what she meant — and I also understood something else that I'd learned from years of this work. The engineer's job on screen isn't to be impressive. It's to be believable. A smooth talker from sales plays an entirely different role. The engineer is there because the audience needs to trust that someone who actually built the thing is standing behind it. Relatability isn't a soft skill in that context. It's the whole point. So I said yes, but I managed her expectations carefully, and mine.

The first session was better than I feared. He didn't yet know how to work with a camera — didn't know naturally how to favour it, how to give it the kind of energy that reads well on screen without feeling like performance. But he was steady. Present. Careful in a way that mattered more than polish. What followed wasn't dramatic, and that's the part that's hardest to explain about this kind of improvement. There was no single session where everything clicked, no breakthrough moment I can point to. Just quiet, consistent progress — each appearance a little more comfortable than the last, the gap between who he was and where the camera needed him to be closing so gradually you'd only notice it in hindsight.

What I remember more than the technique is the curiosity. During shoots, he'd give inputs on how we'd scripted for him — not complaints, but observations, the kind that told me he was developing his own editorial sense, learning what fit his voice and what felt borrowed. We didn't helm all his on-screen work; other production companies were involved, and occasionally he'd DM me about a script that hadn't brought out his style, asking how to explain that to the other team. He wasn't outsourcing the problem. He was learning to advocate for himself in a discipline that wasn't even his job.

He did this for five years. On top of his engineering work, his project timelines, his code reviews, everything that came with the role he was actually hired to do. Scripts written after the coding was done. A second discipline built quietly, in the margins, sustained not by ambition in any obvious sense but by a particular kind of curiosity that doesn't need external encouragement to keep going. He wasn't trying to become someone else. He just kept getting better at something, and he kept showing up to do it.

About two months before his last shoot with us, he told me he was moving on — a new opportunity, his next season. And then he thanked me for my patience on the very first shoot.

He remembered that. Which meant he'd known, even in that first session, that he wasn't ready. And he'd shown up anyway.

I told him it was nothing. That I was just doing my job. Both of those things were true. And underneath them was the envy I mentioned at the start — not of his success exactly, but of his options. He'd built something real on the side of his main work, quietly, without anyone asking him to, and it had opened doors he might never have found otherwise. He could choose what came next. That was what he'd created for himself.

I was the one who understood better than most what that kind of sustained visibility produces. I'd watched it happen up close, coached the person it happened to, and I was still standing behind the camera.

If you're reading this and something in it feels familiar — the good work, the small room, the sense that what you're capable of isn't quite reaching the people it should — I don't think you're missing talent. I've rarely seen that be the real gap. What I've seen instead is someone who hasn't yet had a reason compelling enough to take the first uncomfortable step.

<p class="story-reflection">He took his. It was quieter and less impressive than he probably imagined it would be. And it was enough to start.</p>
