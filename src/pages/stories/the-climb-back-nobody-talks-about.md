title: "The Climb Back Nobody Talks About"

COVID gave us three years of record growth. I should have been grateful. Instead, I was terrified.

The fear was simple: what goes up must come down. We were known as a video production house, and I worried that ceiling would eventually trap us. So when a new team member proposed we expand into a full-service marketing agency, I said yes. It felt like the bold, strategic move.

We invested heavily. New website. Hires from multinational agencies. Eight months of building. When we finally launched and started pitching, I was confident.

Thirty proposals went out. Ten made it to presentations. Zero converted.

Not one. Not a single client said yes.

The financial damage was a few hundred thousand dollars. But the financial part was the easier wound to quantify. What I wasn't prepared for was what happened inside me.

I defaulted into what I can only describe as hibernation mode. I stopped moving. I sulked. I blamed the hires, the timing, the market. I cycled between anger and numbness. For months, I was physically present in the business but functionally absent.

I fell into some form of depression.

I'm not a therapist, so I won't over-diagnose it. But I know what it felt like: a weight that made the simplest decisions feel impossible, and a voice that kept saying nothing I tried would work anyway, so why bother trying.

What eventually shifted wasn't willpower or a motivational podcast or some lightning-bolt insight. It was a friend who also functioned as an informal coach. He didn't give me a strategy. He gave me space to process. And slowly, through conversation after conversation, something loosened.

What I didn't see clearly until later was what that absence cost the people still in the room. The ones who had stayed. Who were watching to see how their leader would respond. They hadn't left. They were still there, still showing up, still looking to me for some signal that we were going to be okay. I couldn't give them what they needed because I hadn't yet found it myself. I was supposed to be the one who turned things around. Instead I went invisible on the people who needed me most. That's the part that stays with me — not just what the failure did to me, but what my response to it did to them.

The breakthrough wasn't a plan. It was a series of small acceptances:

This happened. It cost what it cost. I made the best decision I could with what I knew at the time. The lesson is real, and I need to absorb it — not punish myself with it. Staying in hibernation mode is itself a choice, and it's one I don't have to keep making.

I think about this period more honestly than any other part of my career. Not because the failure was the biggest — it wasn't, proportionally — but because what it revealed about me was harder to face than the loss itself.

The mindset on how we accept losses and failures is more important than the act of the failure itself. We can't control the outcome of every challenge we face. But the type of response we tell ourselves will prime us for recovery — or keep us stuck.

<p class="story-reflection">I don't share this to perform vulnerability. I share it because if you're reading this and you're in your own version of hibernation mode, I want you to know two things: it's real, and it's not permanent. Not because I have proof — but because I'm on the other side of it, and the view from here is worth the climb back.</p>
