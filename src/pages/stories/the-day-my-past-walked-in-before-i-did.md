title: "The Day My Past Walked In Before I Did"
---

Early on, I was anxious before almost every client meeting. We'd done two corporate videos. Two. Both for educational institutions — NTU and Republic Polytechnic. My namecard probably looked like it was designed in PowerPoint. I was not, by any reasonable measure, ready for the corporate world.

Then I got a meeting with PSB Technologies. They made production lines and automation systems for medical accessories — blood bags, syringes, the machines that manufacture what hospitals depend on.

I walked into their facility and something shifted.

I saw experiment benches like the ones I'd used during my electrical and electronics engineering days at NTU. Breadboards. Loose wires. PLC controllers. Half-assembled production lines. The smell of solder. Everything looked familiar in a way that had nothing to do with video production.

So when I sat down with the Vice President of Corporate Affairs and the Marketing Manager, I didn't open with our showreel. I opened by talking about what I'd just seen. I pointed out the PLCs. I asked about their automation sequences. I used the language of their world before I mentioned a single thing about mine.

The whole conversation changed.

They told me their last video team had spent most of the project trying to understand what PSB actually did. Endless back-and-forth explaining basic concepts. The final product showed it — technically competent footage that missed the point entirely, because the team couldn't feel what mattered.

We got the job. Not because we were better filmmakers — we weren't, not yet. We got it because I could connect the dots between their engineering and the story they needed to tell. I brought on an experienced producer who taught me the craft while I provided something he couldn't: subject matter instinct.

I think about this a lot when I talk to mentees who worry that their "irrelevant" background is holding them back. That their engineering degree doesn't matter because they're not engineering anymore. That they're starting from zero.

<p class="story-reflection">You're not starting from zero. You're starting from a place nobody else in the room can reach.</p>
