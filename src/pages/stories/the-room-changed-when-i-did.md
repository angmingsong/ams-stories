## Act 1: The Room I Walked Into With All the Answers

The meeting was in a boardroom somewhere in an industrial park. I remember the drive there — rehearsing in my head what we'd show them first. Which project. Which shot. Which moment in the reel would make them lean forward.

We'd been doing this for about a year. Enough projects to fill a showreel. Not enough experience to know what a showreel was actually for.

We set up the laptop. Ran through our best work. Talked about what we'd done for other clients, what we thought the format should be, what we believed would work for them. We had opinions. We had enthusiasm. We had a forty-five minute slot and we filled most of it.

What we didn't have was a single question.

Not one. We never asked who they were trying to reach. We never asked what had been tried before. We never asked what success actually looked like for the person sitting across from us — whether they needed their boss to be impressed, or their customers to be moved, or their board to sign off on next year's budget.

We walked out thinking it had gone well. We'd been confident. The reel had looked good. They'd nodded in the right places.

I don't remember if we got that job. What I remember is that we did this — the same routine, the same performance — for years. And for years, we couldn't fully explain why some pitches landed and others dissolved quietly, with a polite email and no further contact.

The answer, when it finally came, was uncomfortable. We weren't having meetings. We were performing. And the client wasn't watching to be impressed. They were watching to see if we'd thought about them at all.

We hadn't.

The room doesn't remember how good your reel was. It remembers whether you understood their problem.

## Act 2: The Room That Taught Me to Listen

The project came from a manufacturing company. Industrial. The kind of client I thought I already understood — I'd studied engineering, I'd spent years around technical systems, I could walk a factory floor without needing things explained.

That confidence, it turned out, was exactly the problem.

Their corporate communications manager was the one who brought us in. She'd been with the company long enough to be its institutional memory. Everyone knew her. She knew everyone. When something needed to move internally, it moved through her — not because of her title, but because she understood both the work and the people doing it.

We came in with a concept. Company profile. Here's what you build, here's how you build it, here's the scale of what you've achieved. Standard approach. We thought we understood the brief.

After one of our early discussions, she pulled me aside.

She asked what I thought the CEO cared about most.

I gave her the answer I thought was obvious. Engineering heritage. Track record. The quality of what the company produced.

She looked at me with the kind of patience that tells you you've answered a different question than the one being asked.

Then she told me what was actually going on. The company was heavily dependent on one market — one key account that represented a significant portion of their revenue. Leadership wanted to change that. The real purpose of the video wasn't to celebrate what they'd built. It was to open doors internationally. To signal to a new kind of customer that this company was worth a conversation.

That was the real brief. Everything we'd been building toward was decoration.

And then she told me something else. The CEO, she said, cared deeply about his people. Not the machinery. Not the output. The people behind it. If we put the hardware at the centre and the humans at the edge, we'd lose him before the first cut.

We changed the concept completely. The people moved to the centre. The technical capability became the backdrop.

It worked. Not because it was a clever creative decision — because it was true. This company hadn't survived and grown because of its equipment. It had survived because of the people who ran that equipment, who passed knowledge down without being asked, who showed up when things went wrong and figured it out.

What she gave me wasn't feedback on a deck. She showed me what the brief behind the brief looked like. She decided I was worth coaching, and she coached me.

The best briefs aren't written down. They're given to you by someone who decided you were worth the real conversation.

## Act 3: The Room When I Earned the Right

This wasn't a new client. We'd worked together across several projects by this point. They knew how we operated. We knew their world. That history mattered — because what came next only worked because of what had come before.

They came to us with a recruitment brief. They wanted a video series to attract the next generation of engineers — Gen Z. Leadership had thought it through. They had a clear picture of what would appeal to young talent.

I sat in the room and listened. And something didn't sit right.

Not with the company — the company was genuinely impressive. But I'd started to notice a pattern in briefs like this one. Leaders tend to describe what attracted them, and assume it will attract the people they're trying to reach. It doesn't always match what someone sees when they're standing on the outside — someone new to the industry, who doesn't yet speak the language, and who isn't drawn in by the same signals that insiders have learned to value.

I could have said that directly. I didn't. Not because I lacked confidence in the observation — but because telling someone they're wrong, even respectfully, puts them on the defensive. The conversation becomes about who's right. That's not where you want to be.

So instead of arguing, I ran an experiment.

I gathered four real recruitment videos from four different universities — institutions ranging from the most globally prestigious to the well-regarded local ones most of their actual candidates would come from. I screened them to two groups separately: the leadership and HR team on one side, the company's own Gen Z employees on the other.

The results split cleanly down the middle.

Leadership chose the Harvard video. Polished. Aspirational. The kind of content that signals excellence on a global stage. To them, it was motivating — exactly the standard they wanted to be associated with.

The young engineers chose the local university video. Grittier. More familiar. Less produced. To the leaders, it looked tacky. To the Gen Z employees, it looked like them.

Neither group was wrong. They were just answering from different places. Leadership was choosing what they aspired to. The young engineers were choosing what they recognised.

We presented it not as a correction, but as a discovery. Here's what we heard. Here's what your own people told us. Here's what that points to.

They commissioned a full discovery series — a deeper look at what was actually drawing young engineers in, told through the voices of those engineers themselves.

What I took away from that project wasn't the outcome. It was understanding that disagreement is a craft. You can't rush it. You can't shortcut the trust that makes it possible. And the most effective way to shift someone's perspective isn't to confront it — it's to create the conditions for them to see it themselves.

You can't rush the trust that makes honest conversations possible. And you can't skip it either.
