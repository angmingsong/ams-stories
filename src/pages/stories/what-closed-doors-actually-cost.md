## Part One: The Advice That Waited Ten Years

Six months into the business, I wasn't replacing my engineering salary. Revenue existed, but so did the gap between revenue and actually paying yourself.

An old army commander had been sending video work my way. He'd moved into financial planning and had clients who needed content. After a few projects, he sat me down and said something I can still hear: "Create a repeatable package. Make it easy for people to buy from you."

I rejected it immediately.

In my mind, every project was unique. Creative. Bespoke. The whole reason I'd left engineering was to escape mass production, templates, and standardisation. I wasn't about to bring that thinking into my creative work.

What I didn't understand — couldn't understand at the time — was that he was describing product-market fit. He was using different words for the same thing every startup founder eventually learns or fails to learn. And I failed to learn it for ten years.

Ten years of custom-quoting every project. Ten years of starting from scratch with every client. Ten years of working harder than I needed to because I couldn't see past my own resistance to the word "template."

Today, Mediashock runs on exactly what he described: a focused, repeatable service helping tech companies scale their webinar programs across APAC. One core offering. Clear scope. Easy for clients to buy.

The irony is heavy enough to taste. I left engineering because I didn't want to mass-produce. I spent a decade resisting the business equivalent. And when I finally embraced it, everything changed.

I still haven't told my commander he was right. I should. That might be its own story someday.

## Part Two: The Meeting I Didn't Take

This one doesn't have a resolution. I'm telling you upfront because I've learned that the stories without neat endings are usually the ones worth sharing.

Early in the business — less than three years in — we'd built something genuinely ahead of its time: a wireless video transmission system at a fraction of the market cost. Pre-iPhone era. The technology was novel enough to get us featured in local newspapers. We saw a 30% rate increase, 200% business growth. For a moment, we had real momentum.

An industry veteran reached out. He was well-known in the live photography space, established, connected. He wanted to talk.

I ignored him completely.

Not out of arrogance. Out of fear. I was operating from a scarcity mindset so deep I couldn't see it. My internal logic was: someone more experienced wants to talk to me, therefore they want to take something from me. I had something working, and I was terrified of losing it.

Fifteen years later, I still think about it.

I know what I'd do now. I'd take the meeting. I'd listen to what he saw that I couldn't see. I'd explore how his network and my innovation could multiply each other. I'd approach it with an abundance mindset instead of a scarcity one.

But I didn't. And I'll never know what that conversation could have become.

Should I have just heard him out? I ask myself this more often than I'd like to admit. The answer is almost certainly yes. But "almost certainly" is not the same as knowing, and I've made peace with not knowing.

These two stories sit together because they share a through-line. In both cases, someone offered me something I wasn't ready to receive. My commander offered a business framework. The veteran offered a partnership. I rejected both — one took me ten years to accept, the other I'll never get back.

<p class="story-reflection">The moments that cost me the most weren't the ones where I tried and failed. They were the ones where I closed the door before I even looked through it.</p>
