title: "I Didn't Choose This Path. Then I Did."
---

I was 25 and already a senior engineer. Three years at a telecoms company, promoted quickly, doing work I was good at. Radio frequency management. Network optimization. The kind of thing that's invisible when it works and catastrophic when it doesn't.

But I'd noticed something. The people in their twenties and thirties — almost none of them stayed longer than three years. The people in their fifties had been there for thirty. There was almost nobody in between. It was as if the company had two populations: those passing through and those who'd stopped looking.

I was approaching my own three-year mark.

Around that time, a supplier — a systems integrator operating across Asia — mentioned an opportunity in Sri Lanka. An international role, the kind of thing that would have accelerated everything. I was genuinely intrigued. For a few weeks, I let myself imagine it.

Then my father was diagnosed with a Stage 4 illness. He passed not long after.

I couldn't leave my mother alone and work abroad. That door closed. But the three-year mark was still ticking. And staying felt like choosing the thirty-year path by default.

I'd been doing wedding videography on the side. Not because I had a grand plan — because I liked cameras and couples paid cash. It wasn't a business strategy. It was a side hustle that happened to teach me I could make things people valued.

So I drew on my savings, added the wedding earnings, and started Mediashock. I paid myself one-third of my last engineering salary and told myself I had six months to get back to my old income.

I didn't make it.

Not in six months. Not in twelve. The financial reality of starting something from nothing was harder than any RF interference pattern I'd ever debugged.

But here's what I think about now, twenty years later: I'm not sure I'd do it again. Not because it was wrong — because I had something at 25 that I can't manufacture today. I didn't know enough to be afraid. That naivety wasn't ignorance. It was a kind of fuel. The calculations I'd run now — risk, runway, opportunity cost — would probably talk me out of it.
