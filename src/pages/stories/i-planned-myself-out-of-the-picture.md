title: "I Planned Myself Out of the Picture"
---

Four months before my first child was due, I landed the biggest project of my career. A reality series for iFly Singapore. Celebrities. A format I'd never attempted. A directing challenge that would stretch everything I knew about production.

The filming schedule landed squarely on my wife's expected delivery date.

I was a new father — or about to be one. I didn't know what to expect from either the shoot or the baby. But one thing was immediately clear: not being at the birth was not a choice. There was no version of this where I prioritised a shoot over being present for my first child. That boundary wasn't something I had to think about. It was already there.

Which meant I had to solve a problem I'd never faced: how to make myself unnecessary.

I reached out to a former intern — someone who'd trained with us and was now working as a professional documentary and trailer producer at another company. He was talented, understood our approach, and critically, I trusted his instincts. He took leave from his own job to help me. That alone told me something about the kind of people this business attracted.

Handing over wasn't easy. I'd directed everything until this point. Every creative decision, every on-set call, every edit. Ceding control felt like handing someone the keys to your car and watching them drive away. You know they can drive. You're still gripping the armrest in your mind.

I installed him in the directing role. Then I did something I'd never done before: I planned myself as redundant. I'd be on set — but only as a safety net. An extra pair of hands if something went sideways. Not the director. Not the decision-maker. Just present, in case.

The shoot began. And almost immediately, I started to feel something I didn't expect.

Everything moved like clockwork. My former intern directed with confidence. The team held their own. Decisions got made without anyone looking at me for approval. The rhythm of a well-prepared shoot took over, and I realised I was standing on the edge of it, watching.

I wasn't needed.

Not in the way I'd feared. Not in a way that felt like loss. It was quieter than that — more like watching a machine you'd built start running on its own. The preparation had worked. The right person was in the right seat. The team had absorbed enough of how we operated to carry it forward.

On hindsight, I could have not appeared at all. But based on what I knew at the time, I'd still choose to be there. The margin between "probably fine" and "definitely fine" is where a new father's anxiety lives.

I left for the hospital towards the end of the shoot. On plan. No emergency. No dramatic phone call. Just a father walking out of one chapter and into another.

That experience rewired how I thought about my role.

Before iFly, I was the centre of every project. After it, I started asking a different question: how do I help my team succeed when I'm not in the room?

The answer wasn't delegation — that's just assigning tasks. It was preparation. Sharing not just what to do, but how to think about what might happen. Running through scenarios. Passing down the instincts I'd built over years so that when the moment came, they wouldn't need to call me. They'd already know.

I started attracting and retaining team members who valued that. People who saw the preparation as investment, not micromanagement. People who wanted to grow into the space I was creating for them.

Not all of them stayed. Some left after a year, after two. Took everything I'd poured into them and walked into their next role. There were moments where it felt like all that effort went down the drain. I won't pretend otherwise.

But I've come to think about it differently now. I wasn't meant to be the whole story. I was one chapter — the one that happened to coincide with a particular stage of their growth. What I could give them, I gave. What they needed next, someone else would provide. That's not a failure. That's how it's supposed to work.

I see it in mentoring too. The people I work with aren't looking for someone to follow forever. They're looking for what they need right now. And when they've taken what this season has to offer, the right move is to go find what the next season requires. I hope I'm one of the chapters that mattered. I don't need to be the last one.

<p class="story-reflection">The day I became redundant on that iFly set was the day I started understanding this. Not to be indispensable. To make the chapter count.</p>
